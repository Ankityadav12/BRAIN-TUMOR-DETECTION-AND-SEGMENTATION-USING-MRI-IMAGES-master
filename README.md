# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-AND-SEGMENTATION-USING-MRI-IMAGES
This repository contains the source code in MATLAB for this project. One of them is a function code which can be imported from MATHWORKS. I am including it in this file for better implementation. Detection of brain tumor was done from different set of MRI images using MATLAB. The concept of image processing and segmentation was used to outline the tumor area in the given set of images.
